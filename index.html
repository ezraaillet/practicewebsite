        <h2>Here is a little bit about myself:</h2>
        <p>I am the oldest of six siblings. I was homeschooled
        until 9th grade when I started public school. From a 
        young age, I was interested in computers, and my first 
        experience with code was on Khan Academy, where I 
        learned HTML. I am now eager to expand my coding
        knowledge and learn as much as possible.</p>
