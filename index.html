        <h1>Hi, my name is Ezra Aillet</h1>
        <p>Here are a few things about me:</p>
        <hr>
        <ul>

            <li>I love video games</li>
            <li>I love computers</li>
            <li>I am very interested in learning to code</li>
            <li>Born and raised in Lafayette, Louisiana</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Here is a little bit about myself:</h2>
        <p>I am the oldest of six siblings. I was homeschooled
        until 9th grade when I started public school. From a 
        young age, I was interested in computers, and my first 
        experience with code was on Khan Academy, where I 
        learned HTML. I am now eager to expand my coding
        knowledge and learn as much as possible.</p>

        <article>Outside of coding, I like to build computers, and help 
            family and friends with any tech issues they have. My previous job
            was tech support for Apple, so I am very familiar with the iOS and
            macOS operating systems. Although I do have proficient knowledge
            about the Apple products, I would choose a Windows PC instead of 
            a Mac any day.
